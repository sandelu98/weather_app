In the release of the weather application version 1.1, I've added documentation to all program files including index.html, index.js, and style.css).
Please let me know if there is something wrong.

Made this weather application for educational purposes, learned a lot, and had so much "fun" making this.
The application is not nearly as perfect as I want it to be but as a training project, I'm happy with this outcome.
The project is missing documentation, I will try my best to fix this problem as soon as possible. 
I'll maybe be updating this project later, to achieve a nearly seamless app.
