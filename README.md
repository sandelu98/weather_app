# **Weather Application version 1.1**
In this project, I made a weather application with the help of an API from openweathermap.org.
It starts off by directing you to a common search, where you can input your desired location. When clicked search, 
  the page will transform into a small viewer with data regarding the weather conditions.

## **Weather Application v 1.1 (release 13.11.23)**

In the release of the weather application version 1.1, I've added documentation to all program files including index.html, index.js, and style.css).
Please let me know if there is something wrong.

## **Weather Application v 1.0 (release 12.11.23)**

Made this weather application for educational purposes, learned a lot, and had so much "fun" making this.
The application is not nearly as perfect as I want it to be but as a training project, I'm happy with this outcome.
The project is missing documentation, I will try my best to fix this problem as soon as possible. 
I'll maybe be updating this project later, to achieve a nearly seamless app.
